# jBCrypt

jBCrypt is a Java implementation of OpenBSD's Blowfish password hashing code, as described in [_A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme_](http://www.openbsd.org/papers/bcrypt-paper.ps) by [Niels Provos](http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/) and [David Mazi√®res](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/), by [Damien Miller](http://www.mindrot.org/~djm/).

This system hashes passwords using a version of Bruce Schneier's Blowfish block cipher with modifications designed to raise the cost of off-line password cracking and frustrate fast hardware implementation. The computation cost of the algorithm is parametrized, so it can be increased as computers get faster. The intent is to make a compromise of a password database less likely to result in an attacker gaining knowledge of the `plaintext` passwords, e.g. using [John the Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john/).

There seems to be a lack of good password hashes for Java&#8212;the top two hits in Google (as of 2006/05/24) for "Java password hash" and "Java password encryption" both offer terrible advice: one uses an unsalted hash which allows reverse dictionary lookup of passwords and the other recommends reversible encryption, which is rarely needed and should only be used as a last resort.

jBCrypt is licensed under a ISC/BSD licence (see the LICENSE file for details) and ships with a set of JUnit unit tests to verify correct operation of the library and compatibility with the canonical C implementation of the bcrypt algorithm.

API

The API is very simple:

``` java
// Hash a password for the first time 
String hashed = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt());

// gensalt's log_rounds parameter determines the complexity 
// the work factor is 2**log_rounds, and the default is 10 
String hashed = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt(12));

// Check that an unencrypted password matches one that has 
// previously been hashed 

if (BCrypt.checkpw(candidate, hashed)) {
  System.out.println("It matches"); 
} else {
  System.out.println("It does not match"); 
}

```
